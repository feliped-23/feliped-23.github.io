## 1. Context  
Provide a **short description** of the webpage or design update. Restate the user’s vision in one or two sentences. Highlight the **purpose of the page or section** (e.g., “redesign the About Me page to be modular, text/image-based, and easy to expand”). Keep it specific to **website design**.

## 2. Website Design Philosophy  
Follow these principles when making design decisions:  

- **Clarity & Readability**: Prioritize clean layouts, logical structure, and legible typography.  
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Favor sleek, minimal, and responsive designs. Use whitespace, rounded corners, and subtle shadows sparingly.  
- **Consistency**: Reuse colors, typography, and UI patterns across pages. Maintain a cohesive theme.  
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure layouts adapt gracefully to mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- **Modularity**: Use sections and components that can be easily reused or expanded (e.g., grids, cards, flexible containers).  
- **Performance**: Optimize images, avoid unnecessary scripts, and ensure smooth scrolling/animations.  
- **Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML, sufficient color contrast, and alt text for images.  

This philosophy is the baseline for all design decisions in the plan.

## 3. Relevant Files & Code Areas  
Identify the files and sections that need modification or creation:  
- **HTML files** (e.g., `about_me.html`, `resume.html`) → structure and content.  
- **CSS files** (e.g., `style.css`) → styling, layout, responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript files** (e.g., `script.js`) → interactivity, animations, or UI logic.  
- **Assets** (e.g., images, icons, backgrounds) that need to be added or updated.  

Be precise. If possible, specify line numbers or functional areas (e.g., “navbar section in style.css” or “timeline animation in script.js”).

---

## 4. Layout & Interaction Logic  
If the page requires layout rules, scrolling effects, or interactive behavior, explain the logic step-by-step **without writing code**. Examples:  
- Placement rules (e.g., “Highlight cards should be positioned proportionally along the timeline to the year”).  
- Responsive behavior (e.g., “Switch to single-column stacking below 820px width”).  
- Scroll/hover animations (e.g., “Reveal sections with fade-in when 30% visible in viewport”).  

---

## 5. Phases (Optional, only for large redesigns)  
For larger features, break into phases:  

- **Phase 1 – Structure**: Update HTML with modular sections.  
- **Phase 2A – Styling**: Update CSS for aesthetics, responsiveness, and consistency.  
- **Phase 2B – Interactivity**: Add or adjust JS for animations, scroll effects, or toggles.  
- **Phase 3 – Assets**: Add/update images, icons, or background visuals.  

---

## 6. Clarifications (If Needed)  
If requirements are ambiguous, ask up to 5 clarifying questions before completing the plan. Example:  
- Should images be clickable or static?  
- Should the map be interactive or static?  
- Should the timeline show age and year simultaneously or toggle between them?  

Incorporate answers into the final plan.
