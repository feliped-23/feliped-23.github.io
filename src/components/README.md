# Components

This folder is reserved for future HTML component templates and reusable markup patterns.

## Future Structure

```
components/
├── header.html          # Navigation header template
├── footer.html          # Footer template
├── modal.html           # Modal component template
├── card.html            # Card component template
└── form-elements.html   # Form components
```

## Usage

These would be useful for:

- Server-side includes
- Build process templating
- Component library development
- Code reuse and consistency

Currently, components are defined directly in the main HTML files, but this structure allows for future extraction and reuse.
