        <h1>My story</h1>
        <p>
          I’m a mechanical engineer who enjoys building practical, testable solutions—especially in clean tech.
          From hands-on fabrication to CAD/FEA and data-driven iteration, I focus on turning ideas into working hardware.

    <section class="snap-panel">
      <div class="snap-inner">
        <h2>My goals</h2>
        <p>
          Grow as a design/test engineer, contribute to sustainable energy systems, and keep shipping projects that
          balance performance, manufacturability, and cost. Near-term: broaden prototyping depth and publish more write-ups.

    <!-- Panel 3: My Passions -->
    <section class="snap-panel">
      <div class="snap-inner">
        <h2>My passions</h2>
        <p>
          Clean energy, clever mechanisms, and well-instrumented experiments. Outside of work: hiking, winter sports,
          and learning by building. If it involves a fixture, a test plan, or a graph, I’m in.
